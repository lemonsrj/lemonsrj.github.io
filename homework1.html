        <p>My name is Roger Lemons. I am originally from the Great State of Texas and have living in the San Francisco Bay Area for two years. I currently work as a Program Analyst for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In my free time, I love to travel, watch and play sports and over eat!</p>
        
        <p>Since moving the Bay Area, I have developed an interest in the tech field. This is my third semester with CCSF, taking various CNIT and CS classes. I'm fascinated by web development and have done some minor workweb development work for school and at a previous job. My favorite website is <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google.com</a> because it is literelly the website that changed the way people lieve. I go here numerous times a day to find information about EVERYTHING!</p>
